# Cleaning up the road
A simple, kid-friendly, 2-player PICO-8 game.

Inspired by other PICO-8 games made by parents with their children, I asked my young daughter if she wanted to make a game with me.  *"Yes!"*    
**"What should it be about?"**     *"We would be cleaning garbage off the road."*    
**"And what should we call it?"**     *"Cleaning up the road!"*    

This game is the eventual result after trying a bunch of ideas, testing, and tweaking.  It is not a hard game, appropriate for young kids to learn how controllers work.  With so many games being too difficult for preschool age, I erred on the side of simpler and easier.

_All that said, make sure your kids understand the dangers of roads._

# Cleaning up the road
A simple PICO-8 game I'm creating with my daughter.

Actively being worked on.

This is my first PICO-8 project.  Code is in Lua and the .p8 files are viewable as text, but the project is best viewed in the PICO-8 emulator/IDE itself.

The .p8 file in this repository will be the most up-to-date.  I'll try update the .p8.png cart below and web version semi-regularly as well.
